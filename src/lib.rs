//! The `ka` crate provides several common ***bench***marking ***fun***ctions that are commonly
//! used to test new optimization algorithms. More specifically, the function is part of a struct
//! that contains the objective function as well as other important information. Currently a variety
//! of single-objective and multi-objective functions are implemented.
